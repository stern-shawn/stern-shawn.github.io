Well, it looks like I've finally done it and hopped into the fray of software development. At a recent ReactJS meetup I heard that the next logical course of action was to start blogging about it, and I'm really in dire need of some sort of journal to keep tabs on my work, so here we are! I'll be retroactively documenting some of the projects I've been working on at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) the last couple weeks and keeping tabs on future work here as well.

Now... *let's do this*

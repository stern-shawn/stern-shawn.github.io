#### Some Backstory
Back in June, [HackerRank](hackerrank.com) was running a 30 Days of Code challenge. Thinking that this would be a perfect opportunity to brush up on the Python skills that I had picked up on a rushed need-to-know-for-this-project basis over the last year or so, I signed up and committed to solving the daily problems.

I've decided to go over a number of these challenges and my solutions going forward over the next few posts, as well as a series on some of the algorithm challenges and design projects I've been doing as part of the [FreeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.com) curriculum.

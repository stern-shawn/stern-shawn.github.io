Hello! My name is Shawn and I primarily specialize in designing Embedded Microsystems. While my major was Electrical Engineering, I noticed that my love of problem solving really went wild... during my _computer science_ prerequisites and algorithm classes. Luckily I was able to enjoy combined hardware and software design during undergrad, but once out in the industry, I found myself moving further and further away from my hardware roots and solving problems within my team by generating novel Perl and Python scripts.

In June 2016 I decided to separate from Intel and focus full-time on expanding my knowledge of software development, particularly within the realm of full-stack web development as it offers a wealth of problems to solve and allows me to create code which people can interact with.

Hobbies outside of programming include:

- Weightlifting/Powerlifting
- Kendo
- Playing Electric Bass Guitar for my band
- Hiking around the beautiful Pacific Northwest
- Studying foreign languages and traveling abroad (Japan done, Russia or Germany next!)
